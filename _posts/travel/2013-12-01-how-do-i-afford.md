I get this question from just about everyone with whom I go into sufficient detail about my plans. The answer is that <b>traveling is not expensive.</b>

Flights can be expensive. Hotels are expensive. Paying for these things on top of rent or a mortgage makes them prohibitively expensive. So, <b>I don't pay rent and I stay in hostels</b>.

I'll compare my old living expenses to my expenses while traveling. Of course, I was living in very expensive places so my case is more extreme than many. Costs are in USD.

**Seattle:**<br>
Rent + Utilities: **$1,900**

**San Francisco:**<br>
Rent + Utilities: **$2,500**

**Singapore:**<br>
Round trip flight from San Diego: **$1,056**<br>
Hostel (River City Inn) for 30 days: **$622**<br>
Total: **$1,678**

**Koh Chang, Thailand (living on the beach):**<br>
Round trip flight from San Diego: **$1,195**<br>
Hostel (Cliff Cottage) for 30 days: **$210**<br>
Total: **$1,405**

So, for less than the rent I was paying in Seattle, and much less than my rent in San Francisco, I can fly across the world and live in a new place every month. As the flights are by far the biggest expense, I can live even cheaper if I stay longer or travel shorter distances by train or bus.

Of course, how to make money while traveling is a different question and a subject of (ANOTHER POST).
