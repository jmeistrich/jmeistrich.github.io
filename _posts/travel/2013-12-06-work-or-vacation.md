You get used to repeatedly answering the same questions when you spend a lot of time in hostels. Most of the time these questions come before "What's your name?" The common ones are:

<ul>
<li>Where are you from?</li>
<li>Where have you been?</li>
<li>Where are you going?</li>
<li>Are you traveling for work or holiday?</li>
</ul>

I have a little bit of trouble with the first one. I'm expected to answer with the city I live in, but I don't live anywhere. So am I from San Diego because I was born there? Or am I from San Francisco because I had an apartment there the most recently? Or am I from Seattle because I most recently spent a a couple months there? After a year of traveling where will I be "from?" I'm currently just saying California and going into more detail if we keep talking.

But the most vexing question for me is <b>"work or holiday?"</b> On my last trip, it was easy. I was on holiday. Sure, I was doing some work here and there, but I was primarily on holiday.

But how do I define what I'm currently doing? I'm working, but I'm not working at a place in Singapore, so that's the wrong answer. I'm not on vacation since I don't have a normal life to return to. So I'm not really sure how to answer the question. I'm currently saying "I'm traveling indefinitely while starting a software company." This then sparks even harder questions:

<ul>
<li>Oh an IT guy! You must be rich. Why are you staying in a hostel?</li>
<li>Why come all the way here if you're just going to sit on your computer?</li>
<li>If you're trying to save money, which not live somewhere cheaper? Let me tell you about cheaper places...</li>
<li>You should enjoy your trip more. Come out to the pubs with us tonight.</li>
</ul>

Now they think my life is ridiculous and I have to defend myself. I need to come up with a better answer.
