You get used to repeatedly answering the same questions when you spend a lot of time in hostels. Most of the time these questions come before "What's your name?" The common ones are:

- Where are you from?<br>
- Where have you been?<br>
- Where are you going?<br>
- Are you traveling for work or holiday?

 I have a little bit of trouble with the first one. I'm expected to answer with the city I live in, but I don't live anywhere. So am I from San Diego because I was born there? Or am I from San Francisco because I "lived" there the most recently? Or am I from Seattle because I most recently spent a a couple months there? After a year of traveling where will I be "from?" I'm currently just saying California and going into more detail if we keep talking.

 But the most vexing question for me is <b>"work or holiday?"</b> On my last trip, it was easy. I was on holiday. Sure, I was doing some work here and there, but I was primarily on holiday.

 But how do I define what I'm currently doing? I'm working, but I'm not working at a place in Singapore, so that's the wrong answer. I'm not on vacation since I don't have a normal life to return to. So I'm not really sure how to answer the question. My answer has been evolving over time as I gauge reactions. I'm currently saying "I'm traveling indefinitely while starting a software company." This seems like the best answer but it's usually met with confusion as to when I'm going back to my "normal" life and how I make money. It gets even more confusing when I say I don't live anywhere and I don't currently have income.

 Hopefully I can come up with a better answer.
