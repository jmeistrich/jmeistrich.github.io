After experimenting with [productivity while traveling]({% post_url travel/2013-11-12-productivity %}) for the past month, I've come much closer to figuring out what works for me.



#Productive:

- Living an exciting life and not being bored
- Make wasting time a conscious decision
- Sitting in cafes or outside
- Walking around during breaks
- Fear of wasting battery life
- Having something fun to do when I'm not working

#Not Productive:

- Having internet access
- Having too much fun
- Sitting in the same place every day
- Forcing myself not to take breaks - I burn out without breaks
- Having an unlimited work day
- A constant stream of interruptions - email, Twitter, meetings, people walking into my office

<br>
Some of these things were surprising, so I'll go into more detail.

###Consciously deciding to waste time:
When distraction is an Alt+Tab away it's easy to suddenly notice I just wasted a few hours. If I have to make a decision to waste my time, I can stop myself and snap back into focus. Removing easy access to distraction made a huge difference in my productivity.

###Too much time to work kills productivity:
For a while I would start work as soon as I woke up and go straight through until sleep. I can do that productively for a few days while crunching, but it soon breaks down into getting almost nothing done. Having so much time and no deadline left me totally unmotivated and exhausted. Even though I got nothing done all day, I'd end up as tired as if I did. Starting my day by spending a few hours walk around and taking pictures or having a long delicious lunch gets me really ready to work. Also, having fun plans at night gives me a goal to work towards. Days of working from wake to sleep are good for the day after a weekend of all fun and no work.

###Work/fun balance:
I had been spending all of my time trying to work and rarely did anything fun. Now I've overcompensated too far the other way. I'm working on finding the right balance.

###Not having internet:
I do need internet sometimes - to look something up or pull/push new code. I can tether to my phone for that, but since I don't want to go over my bandwidth limits I quickly turn it off when I'm done. I have the documentation I need saved offline with either [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) or [SiteSucker](http://sitesucker.us).

###Sitting outside:
Apparently I love being outside. Maybe it's because I spent so much of my life stuck inside at a computer. Working in parks or in outdoor cafes is amazing. But I can't do that in a place that's too cold so I'll have to stick to places with warm weather. That doesn't sound too bad.

###I need breaks:
Only when I really get into the zone can I go hours without stopping. Normally I need to take a break after I finish something. Going to a series of different cafes has worked out well for me as whenever I get hungry or need a bathroom break I can leave, walk around for a bit, and find a new cafe.

###Fear of wasting battery life:
My workday is the same as my battery life. If I keep the brightness down, WiFi off and keep it on the integrated GPU, I can work for up to 9 hours on my new MacBook Pro. If I turn on WiFi or tether to my phone, I lose time. If I tax the CPU by loading websites or watching videos, I lose more time. So if I spend an hour wasting my time on the internet, the impact is doubled by the extra work time I lost by wasting my battery. If I have to charge before dinner, I've failed. When I have to consciously decide to spend my time wastefully and know that it has double the effect and I'll thus walk home early in shame, I just don't do it.
