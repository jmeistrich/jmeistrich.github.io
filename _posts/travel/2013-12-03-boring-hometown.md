title:  "My Home Town is Boring"
categories: travel
---

I've noticed a pattern after meeting people from all over the place while in college, at work, and while traveling. Almost everybody dislikes their hometown. They almost always describe it as "boring." Even I do it. My hometown of San Diego is just beaches. There's nothing else to do there. And yet it's a big tourist destination and people from around the world comment on what a nice place it is.

I'm hearing a lot of this in Singapore. Almost everyone I meet from Singapore tells me it's boring and there's nothing to do. They haven't been to many of the tourist destinations and have little interest in them. It's too hot and the culture is too sterile. But to me, it's one of my favorite places in the world and there are endless things to do. I love the weather and the culture seems incredibly rich.

I guess spending most of your life living somewhere is going to make it seem boring. I should pretend I'm a tourist in San Diego and find an appreciation for it.
