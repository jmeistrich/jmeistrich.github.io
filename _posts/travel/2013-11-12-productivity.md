How can I be the most productive? This is the **biggest question** that I'm trying to figure out.

I used to think that a desk with the most monitors and pixels would make me the most productive. At work I had a 30" monitor, two 22" monitors, a 19" touchscreen, and up to three laptops on my desk at one time. At home I had two 30" monitors. But I was not as productive as I could be. I worked at an office in a collaboration space where people constantly walked in an out, and I had a lot of meetings and emails to respond to. I didn't get to work until noon, had lunch, and got started working at 2. There was a lot of sharing of ideas, but I often didn't get any real work done until everyone left at 6 and I could work quietly until 10. Sometimes I stayed until 1 AM when I was really in the zone.

I thought I'd be more productive after I quit and was working from home with nobody distracting me, no meetings, and no emails asking anything of me. But after a period of increased productivity, it started to actually get worse. I'd sit quietly at my computer for 12 hours and get maybe 4 hours of real work done. I could not fight off the distraction of the internet. After every small milestone or food or bathroom break, I would check my email, Twitter, Facebook, TechCrunch, and all the webcomics to see if there was anything new. I'd notice a new episode of one of my favorite shows and put 22 minutes into that. Then I'd get back to work when I was bored of being bored, sometimes an hour later. And then I'd have to pee again.

The worst thing was that I was **wasting my time.** In my non-productive time, I wasn't actually doing anything fun or interesting. When I thought back to my achievements that day or week, I couldn't even think of anything. That had to stop.

I kept trying different ways to solve the problem but they never involved changing my workspace. Intuitively it seemed like having all that screen real estate had to be the most productive possible way to work. I tried to force myself to stop looking at social media or to not allow myself to watch TV. But I always replaced it with something else.

But then as the weather improved I started eating at [Blue Hawaii](http://bluehawaiisf.com/) a few times a week and brought my MacBook Air to get some work done while sitting outside between lunch and dinner. Being outside I was out of WiFi range so I'd have to work offline. When I needed a bathroom break or got hungry I would walk around for a few minutes and relocate to a new location and continue working. Suddenly I was hugely productive! During those hours I got an incredible amount of work done. When I went home after dinner I had to catch up on the day's internet and TV shows, so my productivity hit zero.

It turns out that I'm the most productive I've ever been when I have no internet access, walk around a lot, and stay outside. When I finish a small milestone I have no urge to distract myself because there's nothing else to do. I'd feel stupid watching a TV show in a cafe. Mobile social apps are terrible. The only thing I can do is get up and walk around, and that's enough of a conscious commitment that I can think logically about whether I deserve a break yet. Usually I go right back to work.

Based on this discovery, I think I can actually be the most productive while traveling. It's better for me to work on a laptop outside or in cafes than to work at a desk. I need a constant stream of new experiences to keep me from being bored. Traveling sounds perfect!

So, my first experiment in being productive while traveling will be in Singapore. It's warm enough to be outside 24/7. It's interesting enough to always have new places to walk when I need a break. I've been there before so I won't be too distracted by touristy things. They speak English so I won't have extra stress from a language barrier. The food is amazing.

I have high hopes for this.
