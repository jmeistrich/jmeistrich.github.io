On my previous trip (LINK??) I spent between 3 days and two weeks in each city. The longer stays were mostly a way to recover from the exhaustion of moving so fast on the shorter stays, so I spent a lot of that extra time sitting in a hostel while working or watching TV. This time I intend to move slower and really get a feel for each place. I want to feel like a part of the local culture rather than just seeing the tourist attractions.

I wonder how comfortable I can feel in a place after just one month. I'm going to spend 33 days in Singapore with the goal of feeling like I live there. I will try to meet a lot of locals and do things that locals do. I'll walk or take the MRT (subway) to a different area every day and work in a few different coffee shops and cafes.

I might get bored. I might fill my days with so many activities that I don't get any work done. I might wish I wasnt't there for so long. I might wish I could stay for longer. We'll see!
