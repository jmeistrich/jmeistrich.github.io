My life, which was until two years ago fairly typical for an American software engineer, has involved a lot of very long phases. I was locked up in school until I was 22. Then I worked at a big software company until I was 26. At that point, something about my life seemed wrong so I made a lot of huge changes. I quit my job, massively changed my diet, and left the country. For most of my 26th year I was a vagabond, traveling [too quickly]({% post_url travel/2013-11-18-travel-speed %}) for four months and bouncing around the US for 8 months. In my 27th year I lived in San Francisco and worked busily on starting a company.

Now at 28 I want to make a permanent change and experience more. Every three months or so I will stop what I'm doing and go do something completely different. I will keep working on my company, but from different places while doing different things. This might not be possible. I might get tired of it. I might want to stop and settle down. But I think it's a good goal and will at least be fun while it lasts.

**Tentative Itinerary (subject to change):**<br>
**Fall '13:** Singapore. Eat the best food every day.<br>
**Winter '14:** Beaches of New Zealand and Australia. Play a lot of Frisbee. Study Japanese.<br>
**Spring '14:** Japan. Become conversationally fluent in Japanese.<br>
**Summer '14:** Backpack around Europe. Improve my Spanish.<br>
**Fall '14:** Live somewhere in South America. Maybe Chile or Argentina. Become fluent in Spanish.<br>
**Winter '15**: Live on a ski mountain. Become an expert skier.<br>
**Sprint '15**: Get a boating license and take a yacht around some beautiful area. Maybe the Mediterranean or southeast Asia.
