My life, which was until two years ago fairly typical for an American software engineer, has involved a lot of very long phases. I was locked up in school until I was 22. Then I worked at a big software company until I was 26. At that point, something about my life seemed wrong so I made a lot of huge changes. I quit my job, massively changed my diet, and left the country. For most of my 26th year I was a vagabond, traveling [too quickly]({% post_url travel/2013-11-18-travel-speed %}) for four months and bouncing around the US for 8 months. In my 27th year I lived in San Francisco and worked busily on starting a company.



Now at 28 I'm going to make a permanent change and experience more. Every three months or so I will stop what I'm doing and go do something completely different. I will keep working, but from different places while doing different things.

This might not be possible. I might get tired of it. I might want to stop and settle down. But I think it's a good goal and will at least be fun while it lasts.
