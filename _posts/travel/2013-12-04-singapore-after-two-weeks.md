title:  "Singapore After Two Weeks"
categories: travel
---

I'm halfway through my 33 day trip to Singapore. Telling people how long I'm here has gotten extremely divergent reactions. Locals ask me why I'm here for such a short time or why I'd choose such a boring (LINK TO OTHER ARTICLE) place as Singapore. Travelers ask me why I'm here for so long and suggest other cities in the area to visit. I just tell them I'm happy here.

As for the experiment with traveling speed (LINK TO ARTICLE), I already feel very comfortable here. Choosing Singapore for this experiment was a little bit biased sinced I spent two weeks here in 2011, so the timeframes may be a bit off, but the results are still interesting.

I don't feel a sense of urgency to see everything immediately like I did when I was in cities for just a few days. Being more relaxed feels much better. I feel very comfortable with the MRT (subway system). I'm navigating around the central areas by memory for the most part, so I only consult my phone to find specific restaurants or cafes. I've actually found myself helping local friends with directions on occasion. I've started taking buses when the MRT is not the most convenient. I was scolded for standing too close to the pay station the first time, but I think I've got it now.

As new travelers come into the hostel I've been helping them plan where to go and what to see. Some have commented that I saved them a lot of time researching by just telling them everything they should do. I like that.

I still feel slightly uncomfortable walking into and ordering at cafes, especially the ones where the staff speaks intense Singlish and are slightly hard to understand. But even some local friends have trouble understanding Singlish. I am feeling more comfortable with this every day.

I'm pretty sure people can tell I'm a visitor. A sushi chef asked me how long I'm visiting for. Service staff seems to be more helpful than usual as if I look confused. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I do look confused. Maybe it's my backpack that I carry everywhere. It has my laptop, chargers, camera, and umbrella in it. I carried it everywhere even when I lived in San Francisco.

I'm not sure how to quantify an amount of comfort I feel with a place and whether or not I consider this a "success," but I do at least feel like I'm improving every day. If someone asks me how long I've lived here, I will feel successful.
