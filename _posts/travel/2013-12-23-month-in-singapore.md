Leaving Singapore after having been here for one month, I feel like I'm leaving home. I feel a desire to stay longer, not because I feel like there's more to see, but because I've gotten very comfortable here. It's hard to quantify what that means, but the feeling of leaving and that I will miss Singapore is actually stronger than previous places I've lived. Actually, as I left all the places I've lived, I felt relieved. I relished the freedom of being able to move on and try something new. But this time I feel more like I'd rather continue to explore Singapore.

Of course, I'm very exciting to continue traveling. I expect to throughly enjoy going to Hawaii and New Zealand. Maybe I'll feel this way about leaving New Zealand too. Perhaps I'll come back to Singapore for a while in April when I leave New Zealand.

All in all, I'd say the experiment of trying to [feel like I live in Singapore]({% post_url travel/2013-11-18-travel-speed %}) was a resounding success.
