title: What's In My Backpack
---

I gave away and sold everything else I owned, so this is the full list of my possessions.

![What's in my bag](/img/stuff.jpg)

#Backpack

**Dakine Terminal 31L**<br>
*This is basically a regular school bag. It has a laptop pocket in the back which is very helpful for airport security. Big hiking bags are too big and heavy. This gets me under 10kg.*

**Marmot Kompressor Plus 20L**<br>
*I carry this every day, usually bringing my laptop, chargers, camera, an extra shirt, an umbrella, and a bottle of water.*


#Electronics

**MacBook Pro Retina 15"**<br>
*I can't live without retina. I run Windows 8 in Parallels for when I need to test [Moo.do](http://moo.do) on Windows.*

**iPad Air**<br>
*I use this is a sketch pad for UI ideas with [Adobe Draw](http://www.adobe.com/products/draw.html) and an [Adonit Jot Script](http://www.adonit.net/jot/script/). I also use it as a second monitor with [Duet Display](http://www.duetdisplay.com/).*

**Kindle Paperwhite**<br>
*Books are heavy.*

**iPhone 5**<br>
*I've had this for 3 years now and use it as my primary phone.*

**Nexus 5**<br>
*I mainly use this for testing [Moo.do's](http://moo.do) Android app.*


#Photography

I used to have a Canon 5D Mk II, but I now prefer something small and inconspicuous, something that's light and transportable and so people don't notice me taking pictures of them.

**Olympus E-P5**<br>
*I seriously love the stabilization on this camera.  It's amazing for night shots. And hand-held video looks like it's on a tripod or steadycam. Amazing.*

**Panasonic 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6**<br>
*It's about the same quality and speed as the kit lens (which is quite good) but it's super small.*

**Panasonic 20mm f/1.7**<br>
*This is amazing for night shots. It focuses slowly sometimes but it takes amazing photos. And it's a pancake lens so it's super small.*

**Capture Camera Clip**<br>
*I can attach my camera to my belt or backpack strap with this. It makes it easy to carry around the camera without having to stuff it into a pocket or back into the camera bag.*

**Watson Compact Charger**<br>
*This charger doesn't have a long cord like the included charger.*


#Electronics Accessories

**Seagate 2 TB**<br>
*I take a lot of pictures and have a lot of movies and TV shows to watch if I get bored.*

**Adonit Jot Stylus**<br>
*This is my favorite stylus because it's very accurate. I use it for drawing UI sketches on my iPad.*


#Clothes

I usually get about a week's usage out of my wardrobe. Sometimes I wear the same thing twice if it didn't get too dirty.

**4 light t-shirts**<br>
Purchased in Bangkok for $3 each.

**2 pairs of O'Neill hybrid shorts**<br>
I can wear them for normal life and for swimming. They look like regular shorts so I don't look ridiculous.

**1 pair of jeans**<br>
It's always warm enough for shorts, but sometimes I want to look nice.

**4 pairs of Uniqlo Airism underwear**<br>
Thin and light.

**5 pairs of socks**<br>
*Brightly colored socks that I got at Uniqlo in Bangkok. I often wear flip flops so don't wear these much.*

**1 pair of flip flops**<br>
*Sanuk Beer Cozy (interesting name huh?) bought in Phuket. I have a broken toe so I need really nice and soft flip flops.*

**1 pair of shoes**<br>
*Bright yellow Puma Ferrari.*

#Miscellaneous

**Toiletry bag**<br>
*Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant*

**Shower bag**<br>
*Braun Series 7 razor, face soap, moisturizer*

**ebai USB battery charger**<br>
*My iPhone's battery can die mid-day if I'm using it a lot, so I need this to go a full day. It can charge an iPhone twice.*
